# Deep-Learning

## Spam Ham

This is a classic machine learning problem solved using Deep Learning based LSTM Model. We have built this model using pre processed labelled emails which were classified as spam or ham. We have exposed this trained model DL model using flask api.

This api is consumed by a react based UI which can post preprocessed emails and this posted email will be classified either as spam or ham email.
